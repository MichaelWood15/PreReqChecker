  Description:
  
  Given a text file with a list of each class in the Rutgers Computer Science major these classes prerequisites, this code is able to create an adjacency list of each 
class followed by every direct prerequisite that is required to take said class, determine if a given course could be a valid prerequisite to another course while not 
creating any runovers that prevent you from being able to take certain courses, can determine if you are eligible to take a certain course given what courses you have 
previously completed, and is able to list off what courses you need to take in order to be eligible to take a certain course given a target class and the classes you 
have already taken.
